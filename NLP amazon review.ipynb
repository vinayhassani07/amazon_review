       "[\"\\n\\n  These are so much fun! We ordered the small size, which fits standard hardback books (approximately 5-7 hardbacks in my experience). They're a great way to add some extra storage to our very small home, and we've placed them in our hallway so people ask us about them all the time. I'd highly recommend!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Let me start by saying I’ve got a Master’s degree in English, so I clearly love books! And on that note, it’s a good thing I’ve still got my graduate textbooks - standard-size hardcovers do NOT fit this shelf. There are little hooks on the wall-side that you are to slide the cover into for the book to “float” by holding the bottom cover in place. However, none of my standard hard-cover novels fit - when closing the book upon sliding the bottom over in, the book “ran out of room” and the bottom cover slipped out of the hooks because the book was too small. I resorted to using a larger-width, lighter textbook from my grad school days, and that fit perfectly. The textbook is 8.5” width, while the standard-size hardcover novel I used (and keeping in mind that it was just a teeny bit larger than other standard hardcovers) was 6.5” approximately. So the shelf requires hardcover books to be 2” wider than most books are. On my photos, you can see how much larger the bottom book is than the standard-sized book on top of it.This will work great if you’re like me and have larger-but-still-light books. I initially have it right above my bed, but I will need to move it because I already hit my head just going to put my books on it (haha!) My thought for purchasing this single shelf was to have some books above my bed for ease of reading and then to place my phone on top of, as opposed to stuffing it under my pillow while charging overnight, which I know isn’t that safe to do.Overall, it met my expectations, but thank goodness I had a book that fit. I bought the large, white shelf.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  These are awesome! I should’ve bought the small because I don’t have many large books to use the conceal feature but they work and look fine even if you can’t conceal.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I wanted to mount a Sonos speaker in my bathroom, but drilling through the marble tile wasn’t an option, so I bought this little shelf as a noninvasive solution. I used five large 3M Command Strips (the Velcro ones) on the back, four vertical and one horizontal. It’s been a day and so far so good. I’m sure this is also a suitable shelf for books :)\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I love these floating bookshelves. They give a magical feel to any room. I bought the small and the large sizes. I have used these bookshelves for over 5 years. I have moved twice and these shelves work just as well as the day I first put them up. I make sure to anchor them to the wall each time. I would highly recommend these shelves. For the smaller ones I stick to just books, but for the larger shelves I do a few books and one or two knick knacks on the top.  If you are on the fence about buying these bookshelves, take the plunge and buy them. You won't regret it!\\n\\n\",\n",

By the way the price here on Amazon is cheaper than anywhere else. It comes with the installing screws and butterflies. Carries even more weight than is mentioned on the box.

I have one in the bathroom because I like to listen to music while I am in the shower or bath.  I just had the Amazon Dot sitting on my counter and would need to move it around so often so it wouldn't get wet.  Well after searching on Amazon for a small shelf I came across this.  It is the perfect size for my Amazon Dot.  It was very easy to install. It comes with screws and instructions on how to install it. This shelf would be nice to use for books because it seems like a very strong and sturdy shelf. But if you are looking for a shelf for your Amazon Dot , this is the perfect size for it and I didn't have to pay a lot of money for a larger shelf that would take up more room.  I am very happy with this purchase and I will probably purchase another if we buy another Amazon Dot for another room in our house.\\n\\n\",\n",

Description clearly states that there is no need to drill into a beam, and the shelves even come with a drywall anchor. Sadly it is not so simple, after failing 3 times to get the supplied anchor to stay in the wall i took the shelf to home depot and was advised to buy and use a better anchor which i'm successfully using now.Like:1. The design is awesome, we have 4 on one wall and they look amazing, consistently admired buy guests...2.

They seem sturdy enough, we tested their weight capacity with my hefty outlander books and they hold up well. I would recommend ordering the small size for most books, as the back cover of the bottom book slips into a little ledge that secures the book in place and you want the width of the book the right size so the shelf doesn’t press into the book’s binding.

I resorted to using a larger-width, lighter textbook from my grad school days, and that fit perfectly. The textbook is 8.5” width, while the standard-size hardcover novel I used (and keeping in mind that it was just a teeny bit larger than other standard hardcovers) was 6.5” approximately. So the shelf requires hardcover books to be 2” wider than most books are. On my photos, you can see how much larger the bottom book is than the standard-sized book on top of it.This will work great if you’re like me and have larger-but-still-light books. I initially have it right above my bed, but I will need to move it because I already hit my head just going to put my books on it (haha!)

And on that note, it’s a good thing I’ve still got my graduate textbooks - standard-size hardcovers do NOT fit this shelf. There are little hooks on the wall-side that you are to slide the cover into for the book to “float” by holding the bottom cover in place. However, none of my standard hard-cover novels fit - when closing the book upon sliding the bottom over in, the book “ran out of room” and the bottom cover slipped out of the hooks because the book was too small. I resorted to using a larger-width, lighter textbook from my grad school days, and that fit perfectly. The textbook is 8.5” width, while the standard-size hardcover novel I used (and keeping in mind that it was just a teeny bit larger than other standard hardcovers) was 6.5” approximately. So the shelf requires hardcover books to be 2” wider than most books are. On my photos, you can see how much larger the bottom book is than the standard-sized book on top of it.This will work great if you’re like me and have larger-but-still-light books. I initially have it right above my bed, but I will need to move it because I already hit my head just going to put my books on it (haha!) My thought for purchasing this single shelf was to have some books above my bed for ease of reading and then to place my phone on top of, as opposed to stuffing it under my pillow while charging overnight, which I know isn’t that safe to do.Overall, it met my expectations, but thank goodness I had a book that fit.

They seem sturdy enough, we tested their weight capacity with my hefty outlander books and they hold up well. I would recommend ordering the small size for most books, as the back cover of the bottom book slips into a little ledge that secures the book in place and you want the width of the book the right size so the shelf doesn’t press into the book’s binding.

And on that note, it’s a good thing I’ve still got my graduate textbooks - standard-size hardcovers do NOT fit this shelf. There are little hooks on the wall-side that you are to slide the cover into for the book to “float” by holding the bottom cover in place. However, none of my standard hard-cover novels fit - when closing the book upon sliding the bottom over in, the book “ran out of room” and the bottom cover slipped out of the hooks because the book was too small. I resorted to using a larger-width, lighter textbook from my grad school days, and that fit perfectly. The textbook is 8.5” width, while the standard-size hardcover novel I used (and keeping in mind that it was just a teeny bit larger than other standard hardcovers) was 6.5” approximately. So the shelf requires hardcover books to be 2” wider than most books are. On my photos, you can see how much larger the bottom book is than the standard-sized book on top of it.This will work great if you’re like me and have larger-but-still-light books. I initially have it right above my bed, but I will need to move it because I already hit my head just going to put my books on it (haha!) My thought for purchasing this single shelf was to have some books above my bed for ease of reading and then to place my phone on top of, as opposed to stuffing it under my pillow while charging overnight, which I know isn’t that safe to do.Overall, it met my expectations, but thank goodness I had a book that fit.

I have one in the bathroom because I like to listen to music while I am in the shower or bath.  I just had the Amazon Dot sitting on my counter and would need to move it around so often so it wouldn't get wet.  Well after searching on Amazon for a small shelf I came across this.  It is the perfect size for my Amazon Dot.  It was very easy to install. It comes with screws and instructions on how to install it. This shelf would be nice to use for books because it seems like a very strong and sturdy shelf. But if you are looking for a shelf for your Amazon Dot , this is the perfect size for it and I didn't have to pay a lot of money for a larger shelf that would take up more room.  I am very happy with this purchase and I will probably purchase another if we buy another Amazon Dot for another room in our house.\\n\\n\",\n",

Sadly it is not so simple, after failing 3 times to get the supplied anchor to stay in the wall i took the shelf to home depot and was advised to buy and use a better anchor which i'm successfully using now.Like:1.

They seem sturdy enough, we tested their weight capacity with my hefty outlander books and they hold up well. I would recommend ordering the small size for most books, as the back cover of the bottom book slips into a little ledge that secures the book in place and you want the width of the book the right size so the shelf doesn’t press into the book’s binding.

And on that note, it’s a good thing I’ve still got my graduate textbooks - standard-size hardcovers do NOT fit this shelf. There are little hooks on the wall-side that you are to slide the cover into for the book to “float” by holding the bottom cover in place. However, none of my standard hard-cover novels fit - when closing the book upon sliding the bottom over in, the book “ran out of room” and the bottom cover slipped out of the hooks because the book was too small. I resorted to using a larger-width, lighter textbook from my grad school days, and that fit perfectly. The textbook is 8.5” width, while the standard-size hardcover novel I used (and keeping in mind that it was just a teeny bit larger than other standard hardcovers) was 6.5” approximately. So the shelf requires hardcover books to be 2” wider than most books are. On my photos, you can see how much larger the bottom book is than the standard-sized book on top of it.This will work great if you’re like me and have larger-but-still-light books. I initially have it right above my bed, but I will need to move it because I already hit my head just going to put my books on it (haha!) My thought for purchasing this single shelf was to have some books above my bed for ease of reading and then to place my phone on top of, as opposed to stuffing it under my pillow while charging overnight, which I know isn’t that safe to do.Overall, it met my expectations, but thank goodness I had a book that fit.

They seem sturdy enough, we tested their weight capacity with my hefty outlander books and they hold up well. I would recommend ordering the small size for most books, as the back cover of the bottom book slips into a little ledge that secures the book in place and you want the width of the book the right size so the shelf doesn’t press into the book’s binding.

However, none of my standard hard-cover novels fit - when closing the book upon sliding the bottom over in, the book “ran out of room” and the bottom cover slipped out of the hooks because the book was too small. I resorted to using a larger-width, lighter textbook from my grad school days, and that fit perfectly. The textbook is 8.5” width, while the standard-size hardcover novel I used (and keeping in mind that it was just a teeny bit larger than other standard hardcovers) was 6.5” approximately. So the shelf requires hardcover books to be 2” wider than most books are.

And on that note, it’s a good thing I’ve still got my graduate textbooks - standard-size hardcovers do NOT fit this shelf. There are little hooks on the wall-side that you are to slide the cover into for the book to “float” by holding the bottom cover in place. However, none of my standard hard-cover novels fit - when closing the book upon sliding the bottom over in, the book “ran out of room” and the bottom cover slipped out of the hooks because the book was too small. I resorted to using a larger-width, lighter textbook from my grad school days, and that fit perfectly. The textbook is 8.5” width, while the standard-size hardcover novel I used (and keeping in mind that it was just a teeny bit larger than other standard hardcovers) was 6.5” approximately. So the shelf requires hardcover books to be 2” wider than most books are. On my photos, you can see how much larger the bottom book is than the standard-sized book on top of it.This will work great if you’re like me and have larger-but-still-light books. I initially have it right above my bed, but I will need to move it because I already hit my head just going to put my books on it (haha!) My thought for purchasing this single shelf was to have some books above my bed for ease of reading and then to place my phone on top of, as opposed to stuffing it under my pillow while charging overnight, which I know isn’t that safe to do.Overall, it met my expectations, but thank goodness I had a book that fit.

They seem sturdy enough, we tested their weight capacity with my hefty outlander books and they hold up well. I would recommend ordering the small size for most books, as the back cover of the bottom book slips into a little ledge that secures the book in place and you want the width of the book the right size so the shelf doesn’t press into the book’s binding.

And on that note, it’s a good thing I’ve still got my graduate textbooks - standard-size hardcovers do NOT fit this shelf. There are little hooks on the wall-side that you are to slide the cover into for the book to “float” by holding the bottom cover in place. However, none of my standard hard-cover novels fit - when closing the book upon sliding the bottom over in, the book “ran out of room” and the bottom cover slipped out of the hooks because the book was too small. I resorted to using a larger-width, lighter textbook from my grad school days, and that fit perfectly. The textbook is 8.5” width, while the standard-size hardcover novel I used (and keeping in mind that it was just a teeny bit larger than other standard hardcovers) was 6.5” approximately. So the shelf requires hardcover books to be 2” wider than most books are. On my photos, you can see how much larger the bottom book is than the standard-sized book on top of it.This will work great if you’re like me and have larger-but-still-light books. I initially have it right above my bed, but I will need to move it because I already hit my head just going to put my books on it (haha!) My thought for purchasing this single shelf was to have some books above my bed for ease of reading and then to place my phone on top of, as opposed to stuffing it under my pillow while charging overnight, which I know isn’t that safe to do.Overall, it met my expectations, but thank goodness I had a book that fit.

I have one in the bathroom because I like to listen to music while I am in the shower or bath.  I just had the Amazon Dot sitting on my counter and would need to move it around so often so it wouldn't get wet.  Well after searching on Amazon for a small shelf I came across this.  It is the perfect size for my Amazon Dot.  It was very easy to install. It comes with screws and instructions on how to install it. This shelf would be nice to use for books because it seems like a very strong and sturdy shelf. But if you are looking for a shelf for your Amazon Dot , this is the perfect size for it and I didn't have to pay a lot of money for a larger shelf that would take up more room.  I am very happy with this purchase and I will probably purchase another if we buy another Amazon Dot for another room in our house.\\n\\n\",\n",

Sadly it is not so simple, after failing 3 times to get the supplied anchor to stay in the wall i took the shelf to home depot and was advised to buy and use a better anchor which i'm successfully using now.Like:1.

They seem sturdy enough, we tested their weight capacity with my hefty outlander books and they hold up well. I would recommend ordering the small size for most books, as the back cover of the bottom book slips into a little ledge that secures the book in place and you want the width of the book the right size so the shelf doesn’t press into the book’s binding.

And on that note, it’s a good thing I’ve still got my graduate textbooks - standard-size hardcovers do NOT fit this shelf. There are little hooks on the wall-side that you are to slide the cover into for the book to “float” by holding the bottom cover in place. However, none of my standard hard-cover novels fit - when closing the book upon sliding the bottom over in, the book “ran out of room” and the bottom cover slipped out of the hooks because the book was too small. I resorted to using a larger-width, lighter textbook from my grad school days, and that fit perfectly. The textbook is 8.5” width, while the standard-size hardcover novel I used (and keeping in mind that it was just a teeny bit larger than other standard hardcovers) was 6.5” approximately. So the shelf requires hardcover books to be 2” wider than most books are. On my photos, you can see how much larger the bottom book is than the standard-sized book on top of it.This will work great if you’re like me and have larger-but-still-light books. I initially have it right above my bed, but I will need to move it because I already hit my head just going to put my books on it (haha!) My thought for purchasing this single shelf was to have some books above my bed for ease of reading and then to place my phone on top of, as opposed to stuffing it under my pillow while charging overnight, which I know isn’t that safe to do.Overall, it met my expectations, but thank goodness I had a book that fit.

They seem sturdy enough, we tested their weight capacity with my hefty outlander books and they hold up well. I would recommend ordering the small size for most books, as the back cover of the bottom book slips into a little ledge that secures the book in place and you want the width of the book the right size so the shelf doesn’t press into the book’s binding.

However, none of my standard hard-cover novels fit - when closing the book upon sliding the bottom over in, the book “ran out of room” and the bottom cover slipped out of the hooks because the book was too small. I resorted to using a larger-width, lighter textbook from my grad school days, and that fit perfectly. The textbook is 8.5” width, while the standard-size hardcover novel I used (and keeping in mind that it was just a teeny bit larger than other standard hardcovers) was 6.5” approximately. So the shelf requires hardcover books to be 2” wider than most books are.

The textbook is 8.5” width, while the standard-size hardcover novel I used (and keeping in mind that it was just a teeny bit larger than other standard hardcovers) was 6.5” approximately. So the shelf requires hardcover books to be 2” wider than most books are. On my photos, you can see how much larger the bottom book is than the standard-sized book on top of it.This will work great if you’re like me and have larger-but-still-light books.

I have one in the bathroom because I like to listen to music while I am in the shower or bath.  I just had the Amazon Dot sitting on my counter and would need to move it around so often so it wouldn't get wet.  Well after searching on Amazon for a small shelf I came across this.  It is the perfect size for my Amazon Dot.  It was very easy to install. It comes with screws and instructions on how to install it. This shelf would be nice to use for books because it seems like a very strong and sturdy shelf.

Description clearly states that there is no need to drill into a beam, and the shelves even come with a drywall anchor. Sadly it is not so simple, after failing 3 times to get the supplied anchor to stay in the wall i took the shelf to home depot and was advised to buy and use a better anchor which i'm successfully using now.Like:1. The design is awesome, we have 4 on one wall and they look amazing, consistently admired buy guests...2.

The wall where I wanted, was too narrow for any normal size shelves. So this fit the bill and I think it looks pretty slick! My husband installed them; it was fast and easy.  They seem sturdy enough, we tested their weight capacity with my hefty outlander books and they hold up well. I would recommend ordering the small size for most books, as the back cover of the bottom book slips into a little ledge that secures the book in place and you want the width of the book the right size so the shelf doesn’t press into the book’s binding. I think the large might be better suited for coffee table or art books that are typically a lot bigger. Anyway, hope this helps!\\n\\n</td>\n",

And on that note, it’s a good thing I’ve still got my graduate textbooks - standard-size hardcovers do NOT fit this shelf. There are little hooks on the wall-side that you are to slide the cover into for the book to “float” by holding the bottom cover in place. However, none of my standard hard-cover novels fit - when closing the book upon sliding the bottom over in, the book “ran out of room” and the bottom cover slipped out of the hooks because the book was too small. I resorted to using a larger-width, lighter textbook from my grad school days, and that fit perfectly.

By the way the price here on Amazon is cheaper than anywhere else. It comes with the installing screws and butterflies. Carries even more weight than is mentioned on the box. I have it installed for almost a couple of months now and have absolutely no issues with it.\\n\\n\n",
       "556  \\n\\n  I know that this is labeled a bookshelf but I actually purchased it for something else. I was looking for a small shelf to place my Amazon Alexa Dot on.  I have one in the bathroom because I like to listen to music while I am in the shower or bath.  I just had the Amazon Dot sitting on my counter and would need to move it around so often so it wouldn't get wet.  Well after searching on Amazon for a small shelf I came across this.  It is the perfect size for my Amazon Dot.  It was very easy to install. It comes with screws and instructions on how to install it. This shelf would be nice to use for books because it seems like a very strong and sturdy shelf. But if you are looking for a shelf for your Amazon Dot , this is the perfect size for it and I didn't have to pay a lot of mone...\n",
       "557  \\n\\n  Really wanted to give 5 stars Because i am in love with these shelves. BUT....1. Major lack of installation instructions for a novice builder or DIY'er.2. Description clearly states that there is no need to drill into a beam, and the shelves even come with a drywall anchor. Sadly it is not so simple, after failing 3 times to get the supplied anchor to stay in the wall i took the shelf to home depot and was advised to buy and use a better anchor which i'm successfully using now.Like:1. The design is awesome, we have 4 on one wall and they look amazing, consistently admired buy guests...2. Load capacity, currently have 6-7 medium and large books on it, and it holds great (granted if you actively shake the books or push down it feels a bit wobbly but still sturdier than i had expect...\n",
       "558   \\n\\n  Been needing more book storage and I wanted a shelf that wouldn’t take up horizontal space in our tiny studio apartment. The wall where I wanted, was too narrow for any normal size shelves. So this fit the bill and I think it looks pretty slick! My husband installed them; it was fast and easy.  They seem sturdy enough, we tested their weight capacity with my hefty outlander books and they hold up well. I would recommend ordering the small size for most books, as the back cover of the bottom book slips into a little ledge that secures the book in place and you want the width of the book the right size so the shelf doesn’t press into the book’s binding. I think the large might be better suited for coffee table or art books that are typically a lot bigger. Anyway, hope this helps!\\n\\n\n",
